const description = `Linear Search

Linear Search (or Sequential Search) is the simplest searching algorithm. It checks every element in the list sequentially until the target is found or the list is exhausted.

How it works:
1. Start from the first element
2. Compare each element with the target
3. If a match is found, return the index
4. If the end is reached without a match, return -1

Time Complexity:
  Best:    O(1) — target is the first element
  Average: O(n)
  Worst:   O(n) — target is last or not present

Space Complexity: O(1)

Properties:
  - Works on unsorted arrays
  - No preprocessing needed
  - Simple to implement

Linear Search is useful for small datasets or unsorted data where more efficient algorithms cannot be applied.`
